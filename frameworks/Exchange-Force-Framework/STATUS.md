Proven (unconditional)
- Conceptual framework defining Exchange Force Type I and Type II interactions
- Demonstration of non-fundamentality of exchange forces at the structural level

Conditional (explicit hypotheses)
- Rigidity and correlation capacity implications depend on Exchange Correlation Capacity (ECC) conjectures
- Any quantitative bounds depend on future formalization

Open / reduction targets
- Rigorous ECC bounds
- Proven exchange-induced rigidity theorems
- Integration with EntropyDepth / Chronos frameworks
