Operational Wavefunction Collapse

This repository contains a statement-only framework describing wavefunction collapse
as an operational, information-theoretic phenomenon.

Core idea
- Collapse is treated as an operational update constrained by finite information capacity.
- No ontological claims about the wavefunction are made.

Status
- Structural and conceptual results only.
- Quantitative bounds and extensions remain conditional or open.
See STATUS.md for details.

Scope
This repository is intentionally minimal and frozen.
- No implementations
- No simulations
- No numerical claims

Follow-up work must occur in separate repositories.
