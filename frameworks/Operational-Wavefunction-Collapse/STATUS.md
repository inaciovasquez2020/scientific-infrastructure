Proven (unconditional)
- Operational formulation of wavefunction collapse as an information-theoretic process
- Separation between operational collapse and ontological interpretations

Conditional (explicit hypotheses)
- Any quantitative bounds depend on finite-capacity or transcript assumptions
- Extensions to relativistic or field-theoretic regimes are not claimed

Open / reduction targets
- Formal capacity bounds in concrete measurement models
- Integration with Chronos / EntropyDepth frameworks
