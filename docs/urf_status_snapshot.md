### Yang–Mills / Chronos Update

Component: Yang–Mills HS-Gap  
Result: FINAL-WALL (Gauge Suppression / Late-Scale Decay)  
Evidence: Certified monotone Hilbert–Schmidt growth for Π_T across all admissible scales  
Chronos Tag: chronos-final-wall-ym-gauge  

Status Impact:
- Removes remaining gauge-based escape route for YM HS-gap
- Strengthens Chronos locality-capacity obstruction
- Upgrades URF completeness by closing a dynamic-regime branch
